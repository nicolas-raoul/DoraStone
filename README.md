Casting dynamic maps in stone for off-the-grid explorers

The travel guide [Wikivoyage](http://wikivoyage.org) has dynamic maps that are very useful when connected to the Internet, but unsable offline.
DoraStone solves the problem by taking a snapshot of each dynamic maps and adding it as a Mapframe "staticmap=" attribute for inclusion in prints and offline tourist guides like [OxygenGuide](https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/OxygenGuide) and [Kiwix](http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/Wikivoyage).
